Pip's Arch install script - work in progress.

Does what I need, edit as you feel.

Forked Doc10's code and added what I needed too.

Boot off installation media, partition drive, connect to internet.

Put this together on a Windows machine unfortunately so after using git clone I use dos2unix to convert, easily done. I will get this sorted though.
